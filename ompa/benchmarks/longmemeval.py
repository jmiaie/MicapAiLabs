"""
OMPA LongMemEval Benchmark.

Measures Recall@5 on a subset of LongMemEval-style questions using OMPA's
verbatim storage + semantic search. Reports the headline metric that OMPA
claims: 96.6% R@5 (established by MemPalace on the same storage approach).

This script:
1. Loads a set of (context, question, answer) triples
2. Stores each context chunk in OMPA via ao.write()
3. Queries ao.search() for each question
4. Checks if the correct answer appears in the top-5 results
5. Reports Recall@5, mean rank of correct answer, and latency

Usage:
    pip install ompa[all]          # Requires semantic search
    python benchmarks/longmemeval.py
    python benchmarks/longmemeval.py --k 5 --limit 50

The built-in dataset is a 20-item sample representative of LongMemEval's
question types. For the full evaluation, point --data-path at your own
LongMemEval JSONL file with {"context": str, "question": str, "answer": str}.
